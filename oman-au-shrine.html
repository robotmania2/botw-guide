<p>From the<a href="great-plateau-tower.html" target="_blank"> Great Plateau Tower</a>, run over to the glowing building and swim across to it. Once you enter, place your Sheikah Slate on the pedestal to receive Magnesis. Magnesis works like a giant magnet to pick up metal objects. First, lift one of the metal plates off of the floor to reveal an area under the main area. Then, go through this way until you reach a wall of stone blocks, with one magnetic one. Push the magnetic one and go through. You will encounter a Guardian Scout I. Hit it with your weapon or the bridge. After you use the bridge to get across to the other side, move it so you can access the magnetic doors. To get the chest, pull it down using Magnesis. Use Magnesis to open them, and then you can complete the shrine.</p>
