<p> From the <a href="ja-baij-shrine.html" target="_blank">Ja Baij Shrine</a>,this shrine can be reached by finding the Old Man’s cabin and cutting down a tree to get across the chasm, then climbing the cliff using the small ledges. Go in and get the Stasis rune by placing the Sheikah Slate on the pedestal. Freeze the gear at the right time so you can walk across the bridge. Then, stop one of the stones with Stasis so more do not came out. You can do this again after the second platform to get a chest with a Traveler’s Shield. Go across to where there is an Iron Sledgehammer on the wall. Stasis the boulder at the end and hit it with the Iron Sledgehammer. It will be launched when it unfreeezes. Go to the end and get the Spirit Orb. </p>
