Run down the hill to the tree stump and collect the Woodcutter's Axe. Use this to fight the Bokoblin that you encounter on your way down the hill. Look for two boulders on the edge of a hill and push them down to kill two more Bokoblins. Take their loot. You may encounter some Chuchus (little blue jelly blobs). Hit them with your weapon to defeat them. You will see a rock with a sword in it in a lake near the temple. Swim over to this rock and climb it to get a Traveler's Sword.When you come to the Temple of Time, you will hear a voice say, “Head for the point marked on your Sheikah Slate” After this,open your Sheikah Slate(with the minus button) and stick a pin on the point marked on the map. This is the Great Plateau Tower. Activate the pedestal and it will play a cutscene of the tower rising up and giving you the map. Once you are done, you hop down on the platforms. Do not hop straight off.
