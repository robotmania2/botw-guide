<p>From Owa Daim Shrine, you should get to the top of Mount Hylia to get the Warm Doublet from the Old Man. Alternatively, you can go to his hut and cook some Spicy Peppers into a dish for cold resistance. Then go to the next,smaller mountain and climb. The shrine is Keh Namut Shrine. You will get the Cryonis rune when you go in. First, use the Cryonis pillar for elevation to get onto the platform. Defeat the Guardian Scout I and then use a pillar to elevate the seesaw to go up high. To get the chest, use Cryonis to go across from the top platform. Proceed to the end and complete the shrine. After coming out of the shrine, the Old Man will tell you to go to the point where the lines between shrines intersectâ€¦</p>
