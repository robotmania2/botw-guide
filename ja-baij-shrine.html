<p>Coming from the<a href="oman-au-shrine" target="_blank"> Oman Au Shrine</a>, you will need to go around the Great Plateau. Once you are at the Eastern Abbey, there will be a Decayed Guardian that you will need to either bypass or fight. Climb the wall to enter the shrine and start it. You will get the bomb rune if you place your Sheikah Slate on the pedestal. Then you can complete the shrine by using your bombs. First, throw the bombs at the rocks and explode them. Go to the left path to go to the next area, or go to the right path to get a Soldierâ€™s Claymore. Next, place a square bomb on the moving platform and wait to blow up the rocks. After that you can progress to the final area. In this area, there is a chest and the end of the shrine. Blow up the rocks to progress and collect a Spirit Orb.</p>
